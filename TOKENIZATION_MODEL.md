# Bitcoin Corporation Ltd - Tokenization Model

## 🏢 Company Structure
- **Company Name**: The Bitcoin Corporation Ltd
- **Company Number**: 16735102
- **Registered**: England and Wales
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/bitcoin-corp

## 🪙 Token = Equity Model

### Core Innovation
Unlike BSV/MetaNet which are just open-source projects, Bitcoin OS tokenizes development:
- **Tokens = Dividend-bearing shares** in Bitcoin Corporation Ltd
- **Developers earn tokens** for contributions
- **Real equity** in a registered UK company
- **Profit sharing** from all Bitcoin OS revenue streams

## 📊 Token Distribution

### Development Allocation (70%)
- **Core OS Development**: 40%
  - bitcoin-os repository contributions
  - Core infrastructure work
  - System architecture

- **App Development**: 20%
  - Individual app contributions
  - New app creation
  - App maintenance

- **Bridge/Infrastructure**: 10%

### Business Allocation (30%)
- **Founding Team**: 10%
- **Marketing/Growth**: 10%
- **Strategic Reserve**: 10%

## 🎯 How It Works

### For Developers
1. **Contribute Code** → Submit PR to bitcoin-corp repos
2. **Get Reviewed** → Code quality and impact assessed
3. **Earn Tokens** → Tokens allocated based on contribution
4. **Receive Dividends** → Share in company profits

### Token Calculation
```
tokens_earned = (lines_of_code × complexity_factor × importance_factor) / total_contribution_pool
```
